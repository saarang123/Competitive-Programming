You are given a rooted tree with $n$ vertices. It is rooted at node $1$. Additionally there are $m$ tuples of the form $(u_i ,v_i ,l_i ,r_i)$. $u_i,v_i$ are vertices in the tree such that $u_i$ is an ancestor of $v_i$, and $l_i,r_i$ are integers.

Choose a subset of the edges such that for every such tuple, the number of edges chosen on the path from $u_i$ to $v_i$ lies in the range $[l_i,r_i]$, or state that no such subset exists.
