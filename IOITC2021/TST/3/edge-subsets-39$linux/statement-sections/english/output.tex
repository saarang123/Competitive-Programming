For each test case,
If there is no such subset then print $-1$ in a single line.

If there exists one such subset then

In the first line, print an integer $k$ --- the size of chosen edge subset. 

In second line print $k$ space separated integers $v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots, v_k$ --- describing chosen edge subset. Here $v_i$ represents an edge from its parent node to itself $(p_{v_i}, v_i)$.
