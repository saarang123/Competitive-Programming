First line contains an integer $T$ --- the number of test cases.

$T$ test cases follow. For each test case,

First line contains two space separated integers $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 1000 )$ and $m$ $(0 \leq m \leq 1000)$ --- the number of vertices and number of tuples respectively.

Second line contains $n-1$ space separated integers $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$ --- $p_i$ is parent of $i$-th node.

Next $m$ lines each containing four space separated integers $u_i, v_i, l_i, r_i$ $(1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n, 0 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n-1)$ --- representing $m$ tuples.

It is guaranteed that $u_i$ is an ancestor of $v_i$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $100000$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $100000$.
